# ResistanceCalculator

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Create a console application dedicated to calculating the resistance of 3, 4, 5, or 6 band resistors. This is specifically targeted for students working in labs, who can then reallocate time usually spent towards calculating resistances, towards actual lab work. 

### Project Objective

The project objectives included:

1.	To gain experience with programming in the C# language, specifically practicing new skills such as enums, switch statements, and static vs instantiated classes. 
2.	To solidify general programming concepts such as functions, loops, try statements, and more importantly, error handling. 
3.	To solve a real-life problem, no matter how small, that Iâ€™ve been facing.

## Technologies

The technologies used include:

1. C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp) v1.23.8

## Launch

In order to run this program through the MacOS terminal, run the following commands:

1. csc Program.cs
2. mono Program.exe

## Possible Improvements

Possible improvements for this project include:

1.	Currently, resistance values are limited by the floating-point type (resistance is stored as a float). While the resistance is limited at an impractical value that students will not come across, coding to eliminate this problem will be a good learning practice. 
2.	Create a form for the program, rather than have it as a console application, in which users can physically select the colors and then visually see the resistor that they have. 
3.	Explore how nested classes/interfaces can be implemented to improve the code, in order to facilitate my learning of C#.
